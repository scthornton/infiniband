## InfiniBand Architecture

### The Five-Layer Model
InfiniBand's architecture consists of five distinct layers, each with specific responsibilities:

#### üè¢ Upper Layer (Applications)
**Purpose**: Interface between applications and InfiniBand services

**Key Protocols**:
- **MPI (Message Passing Interface)** - Standard for parallel computing in HPC
- **NCCL (NVIDIA Collective Communication Library)** - For AI/ML workloads
- **RDMA Storage Protocols** - Including SRP, iSER, NFS-RDMA
- **IP over InfiniBand (IPoIB)** - Runs standard IP applications over InfiniBand
- **SDP (Sockets Direct Protocol)** - Provides socket-like interface with RDMA benefits

#### üöõ Transport Layer
**Purpose**: Hardware-based transport services

**Key Feature**: CPU offloading through **RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access)**

**Three Key Technologies**:
1. **Hardware-based transport**: Network card handles protocol processing
2. **Kernel bypass**: Data doesn't go through operating system
3. **RDMA**: Direct memory-to-memory transfer between computers

**Advantage**: Messages go directly from one application's memory to another's, completely bypassing the CPU

#### üó∫Ô∏è Network Layer
**Purpose**: Routing between different InfiniBand subnets

**Uses**: Global IDs (GIDs) for addressing

**Key Header**: **Global Routing Header (GRH)** - used when packets need to cross subnet boundaries

**Function**: Connects multiple InfiniBand subnets via routers

#### üö¶ Link Layer
**Purpose**: Packet switching within a subnet using Local IDs (LIDs)

**Key Features**:
- **LID-based Switching**: Packets forwarded based on destination LID
- **Credit-based Flow Control**: Prevents packet loss by tracking receiver buffer space
- **Lossless Networking**: Packets are never dropped during normal operation
- **Switch Forwarding**: Tables map destination LIDs to exit ports

**Critical Concept**: This layer ensures lossless packet delivery

#### ‚ö° Physical Layer
**Purpose**: Signal transmission over physical medium

**Key Responsibilities**:
- **Signal Integrity**: Ensures reliable electrical/optical signal transmission
- **Bit Encoding**: How bits are placed on the wire
- **Cable Specifications**: Defines characteristics for copper and optical cables
- **Valid Packet Detection**: Signaling protocol to identify valid packets

**Lane Aggregation**: Multiple physical lanes combined for higher bandwidth
- **Formula**: Total bandwidth = single lane speed √ó number of lanes

### Communication Flow Process
Data transmission through the layers:
1. **Upper Layer**: Application initiates data transfer
2. **Transport Layer**: Automated protocol handling and RDMA processing
3. **Network Layer**: Route determination for inter-subnet communication
4. **Link Layer**: Local subnet traffic management and switching
5. **Physical Layer**: Physical signal transmission

---

## Routing Engines Deep Dive

### Types of Routing Engines

#### **Min-hop Routing**
- **Default algorithm** - invoked automatically if no routing algorithm is specified
- Finds the shortest path between nodes
- Simple and efficient for basic topologies

#### **Up-Down Routing**
- **Restriction**: Does not allow paths that go "down" (away from the roots) and then "up" (toward the roots)
- **Requirement**: Needs clearly defined root nodes to establish hierarchy
- **Fallback**: If no root nodes are found, OpenSM falls back to Min-Hop routing

#### **Fat-tree Routing**
- **Best for**: Symmetrical or almost symmetrical fat-tree topologies
- **Self-healing capability**: Can reroute around multiple cable failures and complete switch failures
- **Structure**: Hierarchical tree with increasing bandwidth toward the top
- **Benefit**: Non-blocking bandwidth between any two nodes

#### **Adaptive Routing**
- **Advanced feature**: Dynamically balances traffic and reroutes around failures
- **Real-time optimization**: Monitors congestion and automatically adjusts paths

#### **Torus-2QoS**
- **Specialized**: Uses non-minimal multi-path routing (min-hop+1, min-hop+3) to achieve maximum throughput
- **Purpose**: Optimized for torus topologies with load balancing

#### **Dragonfly+**
- **Structure**: Hierarchical with local and global groups
- **Benefit**: Efficient for large-scale deployments

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Heavy Sweep vs Light Sweep

#### **Heavy Sweeps** are triggered by:
- Server reboots (topology changes)
- Switch resets (fabric reconfiguration needed)
- Any event requiring complete topology rediscovery and LID reassignment

#### **Light Sweeps** are for:
- **Periodic monitoring** - runs at regular intervals
- **Port status tracking** - monitors port state changes
- Performance monitoring (like high transmit packet wait timer values)

### Common Port States and Their Meanings

#### **State: Initializing + Physical State: LinkUp**
**Most likely cause**: No running Subnet Manager in the fabric
- Physical link is good (LinkUp)
- But port can't complete initialization (Base LID: 0, SM LID: 0)
- Port needs SM to assign LID and transition to Active state

#### **Link Layer: Ethernet (instead of InfiniBand)**
**Cause**: HCA port is not part of the InfiniBand fabric
- VPI cards can operate in either mode
- Port is working fine but in wrong protocol mode
- Needs reconfiguration from Ethernet to InfiniBand mode

### Network Connectivity Issues

#### **Credit-based Flow Control**
**Goal**: Assure that packets are not lost within the fabric even in the presence of congestion
- Tracks receiver buffer space
- Prevents packet overflow
- Maintains lossless operation
- This is what makes InfiniBand "lossless"

### üìù Practice Questions with Detailed Explanations

#### **Question 1: Subnet Management**
*Which component assigns LIDs to nodes in the network?*

**Answer**: Subnet Manager

**Explanation**: The SM is responsible for LID assignment to all nodes (both servers and switches), enabling the plug-and-play functionality that makes InfiniBand easy to manage.

#### **Question 2: Inter-subnet Communication**
*How can traffic be routed between two different InfiniBand subnets?*

**Answer**: By using an InfiniBand router

**Explanation**: While gateways connect InfiniBand to Ethernet, routers specifically connect different InfiniBand subnets using GIDs for addressing.

#### **Question 4: Routing Protocols**
*What upper layer protocol should be used for parallel computing in HPC?*

**Answer**: MPI (Message Passing Interface)

**Explanation**: MPI is specifically designed for parallel computing and is the standard for HPC applications requiring coordination between multiple compute nodes.

#### **Question 5: Network Troubleshooting**
*A server shows "State: Initializing" and "Base LID: 0". What's the most likely cause?*

**Answer**: No running Subnet Manager in the fabric

**Explanation**: The port has physical connectivity but can't complete initialization because there's no SM available to assign a LID.

### üîç Common Quiz Traps to Avoid

**‚ùå Don't Confuse These**:
- **Router vs Gateway**: Router connects IB subnets; Gateway connects IB to Ethernet
- **4,000 vs 48,000**: Single subnet supports 48,000 nodes, not 4,000
- **5 seconds vs 1 millisecond**: Traditional recovery is 5s; Self-Healing is 1ms
- **Flow Control Layer**: It's Link Layer, NOT Network Layer
- **LID Assignment**: Done by Subnet Manager, NOT switches or routers
- **Adaptive Routing vs SHARP**: AR is for load balancing; SHARP is for collective operations

**‚úÖ Remember These Key Phrases**:
- "Hardware-based transport services implemented by HCAs"
- "Credit-based flow control ensures lossless networking"
- "Aggregating multiple physical lanes provides higher bandwidth"
- "Subnet Manager assigns LIDs and enables plug-and-play"
